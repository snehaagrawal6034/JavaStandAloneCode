//Use case implemented for Composition
//1. When super-class behavior changes, sub-class functionality can be broken without any modification on its part.
//2. Java does not support multiple inheritances is one reason for favoring composition over inheritance in Java.
//It makes your job simple to have them as private members, and this is called Composition.
//Although both Composition and Inheritance allow you to reuse code,
//one of Inheritanceâ€™s disadvantages is that it breaks encapsulation.
//If the subclass depends on the action of the superclass for its function,it suddenly becomes fragile.
